# sharpPI 

sharpPI is a quantified information flow analysis (*QIF*) tool supporting Shannon Entropy based on the SAT-based toolchain. 


## Getting Started

1. Additional to `make` and `gcc`, you need to install `cmake` and development
   packages for `boost` `eigen3` and `zlib`. On Fedora use
```
     sudo dnf install cmake eigen3-devel boost-devel zlib-devel
``` 
2. Ensure each submodule is checkout out
```
     git submodule init
     git submodule update
```
3. Build
```
     mdkir build; cd build
     cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
     make -j 4
```

The `sharpPI` and `sharpPIg` are  in `build/` 
(Minisat resp. Glucose as SAT solver).
